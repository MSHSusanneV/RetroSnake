# RetroSnake

An old Nokia 3310 Game re-implemented with HTML5 Canvas

## Introduction

This is a tribute to the original, old game, introdused on the famous  Nokia 3310 phones more than 20 years ago.
The game is still alive in many implementations. 
We are presenting it by using almost all the gaming concepts and tools presented during the MMST Boot Camp, i.e. HTML5 Canvas and asynchronous JS.


## The Game

There is one player who controls the direction of movement of a "snake", starting small and growing after catching each piece of food that is generated randomly on the game board. The growing length of the snake increases the difficulty of the game as it goes. The game ends when the snake tries to bite itself or hits a border of the game board.
The player's score is proportional to the amount of "eaten" food.

### Iteration 1: Game objects

Create classes and objects for:
   1. Game object (board, state updates, collision detection)
   2. Snake (graphics, current shape, position, direction, movement)
   3. Food

### Iteration 2 : The web page

Design the page (HTML and CSS):
   1. Game Board (canvas)
   2. Choice of a difficulty level (slow, normal, fast) 
   3. Start Game button
   4. Game navigation buttons (up, down, left, right) 
   5. Display of the current score
   6. Display the "game over" message

### Iteration 3: Deploy and test 

   1. Deploy on GitHub Pages
   2. Test with browsers on PCs
   3. Test on mobile phones
